![David's graph of religious participation vs age](DavidF-plot.svg)

This plot shows how participation in religious and spiritual activity in the USA is different at different ages.  The graph is based on data from the 2017 American Time Use Survey, in which
respondents recorded how they spent all of their time on the day before they were interviewed.
The above graph shows the percentage of respondents, at different ages, who reported that they had spent any time at all on religious and spiritual activity on the day in question.

The graph shows how such participation increases from less than 10% of 20-year-olds, to 20% or more of the oldest survey respondents.  It should be noted that the data for the very oldest respondents --- those aged 80 and over --- is less reliable than at other ages, partly because of small numbers and partly because of the rounded recording of older ages in the published ATUS data.
    
**The above is just an illustrative example of the sort of graph and text you might include in this file.  I fully expect that some of the graphs you'll produce will be more interesting than this one!**

![Maxim's graph of religious participation vs age](MaximB-plot.svg)

This plot shows how the attendance rates of 3 types of events differ at different ages in the US population.  The graph is based on data from the 2017 American Time Use Survey, in which respondents recorded how they spent all of their time on the day before they were interviewed. 

The above graph shows the percentage of respondents, at different ages, who reported that they had spent any time at all on attending sports events, social events and arts & entertainment events on the day in question.

The graph shows a general downward trend for the social and sports events attendance rates. The arts and entertainment events attendance rate is constant around 3%. For arts & entertainment events, the decrease is from approximately 4.5% for the youngest to 3%  for the oldest, and the rate for the sports events falls from 5.5% to below 1 %.

On average, arts and entertainment events have the highest rate of attendance, sports events have the lowest and social events are in between. However, the rate of sports events attendance is the highest for the youngest, but it quickly drops.
